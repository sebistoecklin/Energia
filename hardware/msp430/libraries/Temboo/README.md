Temboo's TI LaunchPad Library
=============================

This repo contains Temboo's TI LaunchPad library. It is compatible with the updated version of Energia that includes the [changes](/energia_changes.md) requested by Temboo. 

##Getting Started##

To get started, you'll need to install the library in Energia. To install a third-party library, simply copy the folder (in this case the "Temboo" folder) to the "libraries" directory in your sketchbook folder. On Mac OS X, that's `~/Documents/Energia/libraries`. So, copy the entire Temboo folder to `/Users/<you>/Documents/Energia/libraries/Temboo`. Instructions will be similar for Windows & Linux.

To run the example sketch, you'll need a Temboo account. You can [sign up](http://www.temboo.com) for a free account on the Temboo website. 

##Examples##

This repo includes a basic Temboo example sketch. The example assumes the use of the SimpleLink WiFi CC3000 BoosterPack (CC3000BOOST). You can find the example sketches [here](/Temboo/examples).

This library has been tested with the following boards:

And the following booster packs:

- SimpleLink WiFi CC3000 BoosterPack (CC3000BOOST)
